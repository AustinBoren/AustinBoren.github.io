*Axo-axonic Innervation of Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons by GABAergic Chandelier Cells Requires AnkyrinG-Associated L1CAM.
Tai et al., 2019 Neuron*

Interneurons arguably make us human modulating the raw output of principal neurons. If their communication parameters are altered at any level disorders appear developmental and otherwise. autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia and on. Relatively sparse interneurons find their way to their excitatory principal neuron partner early in development, wrapping its axon initial (AIS) segment like a rope.

In a heathy brain they wrap the AIS in an intricate way that modulates excitatory output...

In the absence of the cell adhesion molecule L1 things get a little disordered in development and in established neuronal relationships...
