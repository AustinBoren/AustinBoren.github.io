*Axo-axonic Innervation of Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons by GABAergic Chandelier Cells Requires AnkyrinG-Associated L1CAM.
Tai et al., 2019 Neuron*

Internurons argublay make us human modulating the raw output of principal neurons. If thir activty is altered at any level disorders apper developmental and otherwise. 
autisum, epilepsy, schiphrona. Relativly spase interneurons find thier way to thier excitatory partner early in devlopment, wrapping its axon itital segment like a rope.

In a helthy brain they wrap the AIS in an intriatile way that modualtes excitatiory output...

In the absence of the cell adhesion molecle L1 things get a little disordered...
