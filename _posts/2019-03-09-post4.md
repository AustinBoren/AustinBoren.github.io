I was attracted to The Hard Way (THW) because of the title. But I want to learn python the *right* way. Two problems with the hard way. 
  1. It teaches python 2 
  2. It employs didactic teaching over exploratory learning. 
The first problem is simple, why learn outdated information? Focus on py3 and learn need to know py2. The second not so much. I believe in didactic teaching for certain subjects. Programming and math seem likely candidates. But at the end of the day, it feels like I am teaching myself (hence the name of this blog) programming. Constantly scraping the net for new knowledge to update my knowledge base. I *think* Automate the Boring Stuff (ABS) will provide tools and advance these techniques. Also, ATBS looks more applicable. THW builds a game. ATBS manipulates data. 

 So, today I begin ABS. Also, if I never get a job(!) at least I can automate some stuff.
